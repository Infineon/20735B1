# BTSDK - CYW20735

## Overview

The Infineon CYW20735 is an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth 5.0 wireless MCU device. It has a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting BR and LE. EDR is not supported.

## SDK Software Features
- Dual mode Bluetooth stack included in the ROM (BR and LE, no EDR).
- BT stack and profile level APIs for embedded BT application development.
- WICED HCI protocol to simplify host/MCU application development.
- APIs and drivers to access on board peripherals.
- Bluetooth protocols include GAP, GATT, SMP, RFCOMM, SDP, LE Mesh.
- LE and BR profile APIs, libraries, and sample apps.
- Support for Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrade.
- Device Configurator for creating custom pin mapping.
- Bluetooth Configurator for creating LE GATT Database.
- Documentation for APIs, datasheet, profiles, and features.

## Kits Supported
#### CYW920735Q60EVB-01:
- 60-QFN package, Arduino compatible headers, 9-axis motion sensor,
  thermistor, user switches and LEDs, and a USB connector for power,
  programming, and USB-UART bridge.<br>
  Max UART baud rate is 3M

#### CYBT-343052-EVAL:
- EZ-BT Module Evaluation board (CYBT-343052-EVAL) with on board module (CYBT-343052-02), fully
  certified 13.31 mm x 22.4 mm x 1.95 mm programmable module, can be used as a standalone evaluation
  kit or can be combined with Arduino compatible shields, user switches and LEDs, and a USB connector
  for power, programming, and USB-UART bridge.<br>
  Max UART baud rate is 1M. Use baud rate of 115200 for Client Control.
